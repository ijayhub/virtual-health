## About The Project
This is an appointment booking system for a virtual care website using Firebase, React, and Tailwind CSS. It allows clients to book appointments when it is convenient for them.


### Key Features

- Page Navigation: The ability to navigate between pages seamlessly with a click of a button.

- Ability to create an account and login to the website

### Technical details

**Backend (Firebase):**

- I utilized Firebase Firestore to design a secure database schema for storing patient information and appointment details.

- I implemented functionalities using Firebase Authentication to allow patients to register, sign in, and manage their appointments.

**Frontend (React):**

- I use React to build a user-friendly interface for patients to schedule appointments. This included features like a calendar view, appointment details selection, and confirmation functionalities.

- I integrated React Router to manage navigation between login, patient dashboard, and appointment booking sections.

**Styling (Tailwind CSS):**

- I employed Tailwind CSS for the rapid development of a clean and responsive user interface. This ensured the booking system functioned well and looked professional across various devices.
